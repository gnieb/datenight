# Date Night

## ABOUT
We always struggle to decide what we're doing / where we're going. Why is picking a place to eat literally the hardest decision?? I am building this little app to save us from this nightmare.




## Features in Progress

- Explore using the google maps API
- sync up with your partner and share ideas for next date night or where you want to eat dinner tonight
- Chat feature with your partner


## Features Completed

- User authentication and security with auto-log in if you have an active session
