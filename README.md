# Date Night

## ABOUT
We always struggle to decide what we're doing / where we're going. Why is picking a place to eat literally the hardest decision?? I am building this little app to save us from this nightmare.

## Features in Progress
- Explore using the google maps API
- connect to your partner and share ideas for next date night or where you want to eat dinner tonight
- Chat feature with your partner


## Features Completed
- User authentication and security with auto-log in if you have an active session
- Roulette - let the app take the stress out of choosing between several options. Submit your top three choices, and the app will do the rest
- Who's Paying? Skip the fight over it. Fair is fair. Maybe it's just you and your partner, or maybe you're out with friends! Add as many people as you want to this feature and let it do the work for you.
